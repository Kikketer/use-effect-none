# UseEffect None

This is a really dumb project to show how react version 16.9.0 fails to run the `useEffect` hook when presented in an iFrame that's `display: none`.

Check out the use of this on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-innerframe-tezku)

In that codesandbox check to see if the console logs anything from the `useEffect` hook of this app.
